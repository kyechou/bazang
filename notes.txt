- Problem
	- Bring Network Transparency to Distributed Execution
	- What are the limitations on current tracing tools?
	- Currently the granularity is an RPC call/MPI Call: Dapper, IPM
	- As a results effect of network conditions are immediately considered in these systems?
	- What kind of application needs this?
	- Examples:
		- PS vs AR [TODO]
		- Contentions in OS [TODO]
- Challenges
	- Network Tracing deals with packets
	- MPI/RPC may be multiple packets
	- Out-of-band trace collection 
	- Two-Body Problem
		- Full packers call has 4 different pieces on two different locations
	- Overhead
		- TODO
	- Time synchronization between hosts
		- NTP is not enough ms
		- PTP is barely enough us
		- HUYGENS may be enough ns (needs HW support)
	- Missing data by the kernel if the network condition is bad
- Stories
	- Effect of Congesstion
	- Effect of Aggregation Mechanism
- Experiments
	- Simple
		- 1w1s: Size = 10**[1-9]
	- Incast/Outcast
		- Nw1s: Size=1k,10k, N=2**[0-6]
	- TF
		- 1w1ps: resnet/inception, responses
